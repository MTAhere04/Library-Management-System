# Library-Management-System
Library Mangement System implemented using java along with OOP's concepts 
this is a simple mini project which takes the user's choice as input such as whether to create a new patron or to borrow a new book etc.
as this is my first solo project using java programming language along with OOP's there is sure to be many disparities. feel free to mark them out and use the code as you may.
